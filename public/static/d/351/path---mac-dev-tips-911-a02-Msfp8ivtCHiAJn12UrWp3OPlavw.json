{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>Become a More Productive Developer on Mac OS</h1>\n<p>I work on Windows, Mac, and Linux for development, but I generally prefer writing code on a Mac. This is for a variety of reasons, mainly because it is a UNIX system (like Linux) so there are a lot of great command line tools available <em>AND</em> I find that I can be more efficient with the default hotkey commands and tools available on MacOS.</p>\n<p>The goal is to use your mouse or trackpad as little as possible and become comfortable with hotkeys and the command line. This helps with wrist and hand strain, which makes a difference over time, as well as noticeably speeding up the time to complete mundane tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Windows Users</strong>: You can do most of this in Windows too! I'll create a guide later on that.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use Mac's built in \"Spotlight\" utility! Press <code>Cmd + Space</code> to open <strong>ALL</strong> your apps <em>(except VSCode/Your IDE of choice)</em>! Just start typing what program you want to open, then click <code>Enter</code> after a few letters. For example, if you want to open Chrome, just click <code>Cmd + Space</code>, then type <code>c</code> + <code>h</code> + <code>r</code>, then <code>Enter</code>. This is much faster than mousing/trackpadding around your dock or finder looking for an app to open.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The built in \"Spotlight\" app in Mac OS is your friend, and should be the ONLY way you open applications, unless using the command line to launch files/folders</li>\n<li>If you want to try something even more powerful, try <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the <code>code</code> terminal command to open VSCode from the command line. You almost never will open VSCode any other way. In the terminal, <code>cd</code> into the folder that you want to open in VSCode and type <code>code .</code> to launch VSCode with that folder as the VSCode workspace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use <code>Cmd + Tab</code> to switch windows! It's much faster than than using the dock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work in fullscreen mode <code>Ctrl + Cmd + F</code>. You get more real estate on your small laptop screen. And with points 1 and 3 above, you wont need to ever use your dock again. You can switch between apps and open new ones easily while keeping all your apps in full screen mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In VSCode, use <code>Cmd + P</code> to go to any file in your open project. Just start typing the name of the file and click enter. You won't have to look through all of your files and find the one you want to click on. When you start working on very large projects this will be a godsend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>VSCode has hundreds of hotkeys. Start using them now and get to know them. If you find yourself using your mouse to copy, paste, and move text around... you are doing it wrong. I'm not going to go over all of these, but you can find most of them here: <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Try this one to see how much time it can save you: To select a word, use <code>Cmd + D</code>. If you hit <code>Cmd + D</code> more than once, youâ€™ll add another occurrence of the same keyword to your selection. Now start editing or deleting the first selection.... It edits all of them at the same time! This may not seem like much now, but believe me, it's huge!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BONUS: If you want to get really crazy, try the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb\">Vimium</a> extension for Chrome. Surf the web without ever needing to use your mouse/trackpad!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-10","title":"MacOS Productivity Tips","tags":["macos","tips"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/f1b0d/hackerman.jpg","srcSet":"/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/d0dfe/hackerman.jpg 480w,\n/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/f1b0d/hackerman.jpg 960w","srcWebp":"/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/90076/hackerman.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/7eb57/hackerman.webp 480w,\n/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/90076/hackerman.webp 960w","sizes":"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/514c8eddd640db40d9a39b894fbe6f27/d260a/hackerman.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/mac-dev-tips","prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/linux-on-win10-setup","title":"Linux Z-Shell On Windows 10","tags":["zsh","wsl","linux"]}}}}
